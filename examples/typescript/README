Important:

The strange lib array in tsconfig.json is needed because of an issue in the TS
GraphQL libraries: https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-subscriptions/issues/83

Regardless if you use it or not, the build will fail without them!
The lib configuration can and should be removed as soon as the issue has been fixed.

You can also try to invoke a function locally:
```
serverless invoke local --function=hello --path=./event.json
```
